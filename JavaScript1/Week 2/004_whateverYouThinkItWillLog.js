// 4 - Declare a variable y and assign a string to it
let y = '11, 13, 17, number eleven, thirteen and seventeen';


// 4.1 - Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is:
console.log('The string will be: 11, 13, 17, number eleven, thirteen and seventeen.');


// 4.2 -  Now console.log the variable y:
console.log(y);


// 4.3 - Now assign a new string to the variable y:
y = 'This is my new string ans it looks cool!';


// 4.4 - Just like what you did before write a console.log statement
// that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console:
console.log('It\'s going to log: \'This is my new string ans it looks cool!\'');

// 4.5 -  Now console.log y again:
console.log(y);
